# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
A Simple Comparison Between  Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost  Model.

In this project, I have train 3 Machine Learning Algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost to predict the price of used cars.

## Multiple Linear Regression
In Multiple Linear Regression, we predict the value of target variable Y based on Feature Variable(s) X.

Where, X is called the Independent Variable and Y is called the Dependent Variable.


## Random Forest Regression
Random Forest Regressor is a type of ensemble algorithm. It creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of training set. It then combines all the predicted values from different decision trees and find the average of them


## XGBoost
XGBoost is a supervised learning algorithm and implements gradient boosted trees algorithm. The algorithm work by combining an ensemble of predictions from several weak models. It is robust to many data distributions and relationships and offers many hyperparameters to tune model performance. XGBoost offers increased speed and enhanced memory utilization. XGBoost is analogous to the idea of "discovering truth by building on previous discoveries".
